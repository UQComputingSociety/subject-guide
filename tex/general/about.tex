\section{About}
Welcome to the 2016 UQCS Subject Guide!

This guide offers an overview of the courses undertaken by Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Information and Technology.
It aims to help students make informed choices about their study at UQ.

It is produced by the UQ Computing Society, and is in no way an official UQ guide --- for academic advice, be sure to talk to your school or faculty.
