    Not a difficult course provided you keep up with course materials, but assignments will take a good chunk of time. Matt and Tutors extremely helpful and very short response times. \\
    Through the course you will cover the different parts that make up an operating system kernel (especially a linux kernel), and assignments focus on concurrency and display (X11, but almost any display driver will be accepted). \\
    Note that while the textbook is mandatory, it is extremely useful. You will cover the entirety of the textbook throughout the course. \\
    The exam is fairly easy to prepare for, but going in without doing previous year's exams will result in failure. \\
    If you enjoyed 2310, I would highly recommend this course.
