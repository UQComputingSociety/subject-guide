review = {
    This course is UQ's introductory programming course; it does not assume any prior programming experience and is often taken by students outside of ITEE, as well as being compulsory for most ITEE degrees.\\
    
    The course teaches students Python 3 programming, covering imperative programming, introducing object orientation, as well as GUI programming with the TKinter library. After each assignment, students are `interviewed' by a tutor, with marking occurring at that time. Your ability to explain your assignment forms a component of your mark.\\
    
    The final exam is entirely multiple choice, and questions are often taken directly from past years, so studying past papers is highly advised. Time is usually not a huge pressure in the final exam, as many multiple choice questions can be answered very quickly.\\
    
    For students with prior programming experience (hobbyist or formal), the course's content will likely be retreading familiar topics and will overall be quite easy. The course will require more effort for those with no programming experience, but a high grade is still quite achievable.\\
