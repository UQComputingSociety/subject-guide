review = {
    This course has changed significantly from year to year, depending on the course coordinator. This review is based on the 2016 version of the course, taught by Professor Sanderson.\\
    
    The course covers Human-Computer Interaction and Interaction Design. It covers cognitive, emotional and social aspects of HCI as well as laying out the Interaction Design process and tools used in ID. The course overall feels like a psychology or social science course in its focus, and as such may be quite different to what most students in ITEE degrees are used to.\\
    
    However, the actual course assessment is quite easy. The marked practicals mean that attendance is mandatory, but the tasks are quite simple. The last five weeks of practicals are a `linked project' where groups go through designing and evaluating the interface for an app.\\
    
    The difficulty of the report varies depending on topic chosen, but it is expected to be thoroughly researched and based on peer-reviewed sources. Though the final exam is entirely closed book and reliant on memorisation of content, at least in 2016 it was very easy, with many questions directly pulled from the only previous past exam paper (2013).
